# WebUI Idea Memo (no eta, no guarantee)
It can turn on by running `/sentry webui`, it will generates URL for check some violation data from web.
After open the link, it will send message to server to let accept connection. It will show verification code, and put the code on web to get access.
In WebUI you can see these informations:
1. Player list
2. Violation datas
3. debug informations
